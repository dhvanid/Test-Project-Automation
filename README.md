# Test-Project-Automation

TestProject is an end to end framework for test automation of mobile and web apps. It aims to simplify your test automation experience while offering infinite customization through a gallery of add-ons.

What makes this tool really cool is that itâ€™s a first of its kind free community-powered cloud platform that can be used to record, develop and analyze test automation.

Another cool thing about TestProject is that it easily supports so many platforms like Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, Webservices.

I have created automated test cases of an application website using Test Project tool.

In this repository I have added the details of the automated testing that I have carried out and the test case reports along with the generated code.
